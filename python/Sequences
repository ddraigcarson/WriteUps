# Sequences

Python has these built in sequences that are implemented in C:

##### Container sequences - 
list, tuples and collections.deque
They hold references and can hold objects of different types

##### Flat sequences
str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview and array.array 
They hold only one type and physically store the value in their memory space thus they are more compact but are limited to storing primitive types like char, bytes and numbers

Another way to group them could be 

##### Mutable
list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, memoryview

##### Immutable
tuple, str and bytes

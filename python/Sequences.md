# Sequences

Python has these built in sequences that are implemented in C:

##### Container sequences - 
list, tuples and collections.deque
They hold references and can hold objects of different types

##### Flat sequences
str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview and array.array 
They hold only one type and physically store the value in their memory space thus they are more compact but are limited to storing primitive types like char, bytes and numbers

Another way to group them could be 

##### Mutable
list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, memoryview

##### Immutable
tuple, str and bytes

### List comprehensions or Listcomps
A listcomp can be used to create a list, same way as a for loop but it is often quicker and more readable to use the list comp
```python
symbols = '$¢£¥€¤'
codes = [ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols]
```
In Python 3 they have their own scope but in 2.X variables declared inside would leak into the outer scope. They will also not mask the scope of surrounding scopes e.g. 

```python
>>> x = 'ABC'
>>> dummy = [ord(x) for x in x]
>>> x  #1
'ABC'
>>> dummy  #2
[65, 66, 67]

#1 The value of x is preserved.

#2 The list comprehension produces the expected list.
```
They are equivilent to map and filter in terms of speed, though this is not a common held belief.
They can be nested, see this example for a cartesian product of two lists:
```python
>>> colors = ['black', 'white']
>>> sizes = ['S', 'M', 'L']
>>> tshirts = [(color, size) for color in colors for size in sizes]  1
>>> tshirts
[('black', 'S'), ('black', 'M'), ('black', 'L'), ('white', 'S'),
 ('white', 'M'), ('white', 'L')]
```

### Generator Expressions
To generate other types of sequences we can use genexps. It can save memory as it yields items one at a time using the iterator protocol instead of building the whole list at once.

```python
>>> symbols = '$¢£¥€¤'
>>> tuple(ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols)  1
(36, 162, 163, 165, 8364, 164)
```

### Tuples
##### Tuple unpacking
The star operator can be used when calling a function to catch all other items

```python
>>> a, *b, c = range(5)
>>> a
0
>>> c
4
>>> b
[1, 2, 3]
```

The unpacking can also work for nested structures
